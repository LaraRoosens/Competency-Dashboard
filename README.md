# Competency-Dashboard

This competency dashboard is part of the masterâ€™s thesis of Lara Roosens. This master's thesis focused on designing, developing, and evaluating a learning analytics plugin for Moodle, specifically targeting secondary school teachers. The plugin functions as a learning analytics dashboard, providing a visual overview of essential information from learning analytics. The goal is to assist secondary school teachers by offering them the necessary information to gain a better understanding of their students, make informed decisions, and reduce administrative tasks.
